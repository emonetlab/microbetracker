# microbetracker
MicrobeTracker Suite is a MATLAB-based software package designed to detect and outline bacterial cells in microscopy images and to analyze fluorescence signal inside them. The Suite consists of the MicrobeTracker program itself, which outlines and tracks the cells, a few tools for spot detection inside cells under the general name SpotFinder, and a number of supporting functions for displaying the data and performing primary data analysis. The data is saved in comprehensive MATLAB format and can be processed by the user directly. The Suite requires MATLAB with Image Processing toolbox. This software is no longer supported.
